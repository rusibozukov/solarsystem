# Solar System Visualization Project

This project visualizes an imaginary solar system using Python. It features a central star and several planets orbiting around it, created with the help of NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Files in the Project

- **sonnensystem.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code that generates the solar system visualization.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the dependencies required to run the project.
- **README.md**: This documentation file provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## Installation

To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the `sonnensystem.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment to visualize the solar system. The notebook will generate a plot displaying the central star and the planets in their respective orbits.
